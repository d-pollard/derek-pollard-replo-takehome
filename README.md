Interview question we use for coding screens


## Developer thoughts
Don't waste your time applying to this company. They will ask you irrelevant interview questions in fields you aren't versed in. For me, they gave me a systems architecture interview when the position I applied to was Senior Front End Engineer.

This was after I had aced this take home AND aced a pair programming interview.

Good luck and happy job hunting!

to me, Noah
Hey Derek,

Thanks for taking the time to chat today — took a walk and thought about this after our call and chatted with Noah on the phone about this one, tl;dr I don't think we'll be able to move forward here. 

Very transparent thoughts here — I wanna acknowledge your strong technical capabilities here and you're obviously very smart and I don't doubt you'll find a great role in the coming weeks. However, I do feel like there's a gap with working and problem-solving styles here which to be very honest, I have a hard time putting a finger on. As much as I think you'll be super productive on our team, it's probably a bigger risk than we're willing to take on right now with a small team.

Would love to keep in touch and genuinely was fun jamming with you over the last few calls.

Cheers,
Yuxin
