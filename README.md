Interview question we use for coding screens


## Developer thoughts
Don't waste your time applying to this company. They will ask you irrelevant interview questions in fields you aren't versed in. For me, they gave me a systems architecture interview when the position I applied to was Senior Front End Engineer.

This was after I had aced this take home AND aced a pair programming interview.

Good luck and happy job hunting!
